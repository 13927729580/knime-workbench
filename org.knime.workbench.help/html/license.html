<title>KNIME: License</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>KNIME is available under a dual licensing model. An open source
license is available for non-profit use as well as for-profit internal
use by commercial organizations, provided such organizations do not
distribute KNIME to third parties in exchange for payment. If you wish
to distribute KNIME to third parties on a paid basis, please contact us
at <a href="mailto:contact@knime.org">contact@knime.org</a> to discuss
licensing arrangements.</p>

<h1>KNIME open source license</h1>
<p>The detailed open source license is available <a
	href="AladdinLicenseForKNIME.html">here</a>!<br />
A summary of the license follows, but please note that only the actual
terms and conditions of the Aladdin Free Public License, linked to
above, govern your rights to use KNIME. This summary is provided for
your convenience and you should consult your own lawyers to confirm this
interpretation.</p>

<h2>KNIME Open Source License Model in a Nutshell:</h2>
<br />

<p>We consider KNIME to be a research and teaching platform and want
it to be used in this environment as much as possible. Therefore the
license aims to make non-profit usage, non-profit distribution and
internal use (even for commercial purposes) free. However, you may not
distribute KNIME for a profit without our permission, as explained in
the Aladdin Free Public License and below. We decided against using the
well known GPL license for two reasons. Firstly, KNIME is an environment
that is modular and therefore external contributions will mainly result
in additional nodes - where insights into the core code are useful but
changes/extensions to the core are not required. We envision most
external contributions to be related to new nodes. We provide source
code of the KNIME core for this reason but we would like to ask that you
do not change the core without contacting us (although you are allowed
to change it under the current license). Secondly, since the core of
KNIME is crucial for all other pieces to work smoothly we would like to
keep control over future developments. People who are interested in
contributing to the KNIME core development are encouraged to contact us,
of course. If you have written a new node that you believe is
interesting to others, please let us know and we would be happy to point
to your site or include it in our list of external
contributions/extensions. We are very interested in getting input both
with ideas and actual contributions and we hope to be able to offer
KNIME stipends in the future from income through the second, commercial
license of KNIME (see below).</p>
<br />

<p>So, what about commercial use of KNIME? Well, we believe that if
someone does make money from distributing KNIME, KNIME should benefit
from it. So we do offer licensing models for commerical resellers and
sublicensors that help us further develop the core and continue to add
modules. Commercial licensing schemes can, for example, involve making
code contributions or royalty payments that enable us to hire
programmers or fund KNIME stipends. Note that using KNIME for your own,
internal data analysis work is free under the current license, even if
such internal data analysis work is used to generate profit for yourself
or the company (so long as the source of profit is not the distribution
of KNIME or the sale of services or other products bundled with KNIME,
as explained in the Aladdin Free Public License).</p>

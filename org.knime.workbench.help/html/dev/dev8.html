<h2>How to adapt your NodeDescription</h2>
<p>The NodeDescription is the information displayed in the
NodeDescription window of your workbench. You can edit the information
in the XML file, which is named exactly like your NodeFactory. In our
case it is the NumericBinnerNodeFactory.xml. The NodeDescription
explains the functionality of the node, the configuration options, the
node's view and the meaning of the in- and outports. Since we added a
ModelOutport we also have to add a description of that port. When you
look at the NumericBinnerNodeFactory.xml file you will notice that there
are already some fields but most of them filled with placeholders. We
will go through each of the fields and add the appropriate information.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>fullDescription: The full description should explain the
	functionality of your node and help a user to use it. For example:
	&quot;divides the domain of a selected numeric column into the selected
	number of equidistant bins and puts the input data into these bins
	accourdingly. The binning information (which row is in which bin) is
	provided in an extra column at the output.&quot;</li>
	<li>option: for each control element in your dialog describe the
	meaning of it here. The option name is the label of it used in the
	dialog. We add: <br />
	&lt;option name="Number of bins"&gt;Define the number of
	bins&lt;/option&gt; <br />
	&lt;option name="Column to bin"&gt;Select the numeric column which
	should be binned&lt;/option&gt;</li>
	<li>ports:
	<ul>
		<li>dataIn: the data inports with the index - a name displayed in
		the tooltip and a description, which is displayed in the
		NodeDescription,</li>
		<li>dataOut: the data outports with the index, a name displayed
		in the tooltip and in the context menu and a description, which is
		displayed in the NodeDescription,</li>
		<li>modelIn: the model inports with the index, a name displayed
		in the tooltip and a description for the NodeDescription,</li>
		<li>modelOut: the model outports with the index, a name displayed
		in the tooltip and the context menu and a description for the
		NodeDescription.</li>
	</ul>
	We add: <br />
	&lt;ports&gt; <br />
	&lt;dataIn index="0" name="Data to bin"&gt;Data to bin&lt;/dataIn&gt; <br />
	&lt;dataOut index="0" name="Binned data"&gt;The input data with an
	additional column containing the referring bin number for each
	row.&lt;/dataOut&gt; <br />
	&lt;modelOut index="0" name="Bin intervals"&gt;Bounds of the
	intervals&lt;/modelOut&gt;<br />
	&lt;/ports&gt;</li>
	<li>views: explains what is displayed in the view with an index of
	the view (since a node may have several views), a name displayed in the
	context menu and a description for the NodeDescription. We add:<br />
	&lt;views&gt;<br />
	&lt;view index="0" name="Histogram"&gt;Displays the relative size of
	each bin in a histogram&lt;/view&gt; <br />
	&lt;/views&gt;</li>
</ul>

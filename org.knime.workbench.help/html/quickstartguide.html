<h2>Installing KNIME</h2>

<p>The installation procedure is illustrated for the standalone
version of KNIME.</p>

<h3>Windows users</h3>
<p>Download the standalone version of KNIME from <a
	href="http://www.knime.org/download/win32/knime_win32.x86.zip">
http://www.knime.org/download/win32/knime_win32.x86.zip</a>. Extract the
downloaded zip file to any directory on which you have write
permissions.</p>

<p>This is all that is needed to install KNIME. There is no need to
execute a Setup application or set any variables. KNIME will not leave
many traces in your system.</p>

<h3>Linux users</h3>
<p>Download the standalone version of KNIME from <a
	href="http://www.knime.org/download/linux/knime_linux.gtk.x86.tar.gz">
http://www.knime.org/download/linux/knime_linux.gtk.x86.tar.gz</a>. Extract
the downloaded archive to any directory on which you have write
permissions.</p>
<p>This is all that is needed to install KNIME. There is no need to
execute a Setup application or set any variables. KNIME will not leave
many traces in your system.</p>


<h3>Sample data sets</h3>

<p>After installation, in the root directory of KNIME you will find
the sub directory "IrisDataset", which contains a small dataset on iris
plants. The dataset has five columns (attributes). Each row represents a
single iris plant. The first four columns describe the width and length
of the two characteristical leaves of an iris plant. The fifth column
describes the class the iris belongs to. This dataset represents a
simple classification dataset and can easily be used to get to know to
the basics of KNIME.</p>

<p>More example datasets can be downloaded from our web site at <a
	href="http://www.knime.org/download/datasets.zip">http://www.knime.org/download/datasets.zip</a>.
</p>

<h2>Starting the Application</h2>

<p>In the KNIME root directory the application is started via</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>knime.exe</em> (for Windows) and</li>
	<li><em>knime.sh</em> (Linux).</li>
</ul>
<p>After the application has been started the KNIME application
window appears (the screen shots in the following haven been taken from
the Windows version).</p>

<p><img
	src="img/quick/emptyWorkbench_small.png" alt="empty KNIME workflow" />
</p>

<p>KNIME is implemented as an Eclipse Plugin. The current KNIME
product version 1.2.1 is running on the Eclipse version 3.2. For details
on using the Eclipse workbench we refer to the User Guide at <a
	href="http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/">http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/</a>
or the "Help" menu of KNIME which also includes the Eclipse workbench
help.</p>
<p>In the following the different parts of the KNIME workbench (see
the above screenshot) are described.</p>

<h3>Editor Window:</h3>
<p>The big window in the middle is the editor window in which data
analysis flows are constructed.</p>


<h3>Node Repository:</h3>
<p>The lower-left <em>Node Repository</em> provides you with a view
that lists all nodes (modules), grouped in several category folders.
From here you can Drag&amp;Drop nodes to the editor window as you need
them.</p>

<h3>Console:</h3>
<p>The <em>Console</em> view, in the lower part of the screen,
displays error and warning messages. They are also sent to the log file.
You may change the log level (DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) under File -&gt;
Preferences -&gt; KNIME.</p>


<h3>Node Description:</h3>
<p>The <em>Node Description</em> view provides information about
selected nodes (this view is empty in the picture above, because no node
has been selected yet). It also shows the content of a node category if
a category has been selected in the <em>Node Repository</em> view.</p>

<h3>Workflow Projects Navigator:</h3>
<p>The workflow projects navigator window shows all currently
defined workflow projects. The context menu of the navigator allows you
to create new projects, import existing workflows into the workbench and
export own workflows. Each project is saved in the workspace. The
workspace is located in your KNIME installation directory by default
(see below how to change this). On the file system a workflow project
consist of several files and folders to store the current status of a
flow; this structure is not visible in the <em>Workflow Projects
Navigator</em> as it represents internal information not intended to be
changed manually.</p>

<h2>Getting More Functionality</h2>
<p>KNIME allows to easily integrate new modules, i.e. analysis
nodes. Available are node extensions at our Update Site. A convenient
way to download these new KNIME features is via the KNIME update
mechanism. In KNIME select "File", "Update KNIME..." (or in the
Developer Version it is "Help", "Software Updates", "Find and
Install..."). The Update Wizard opens. If you expand the KNIME site, you
see three main categories, (dependent on whether you use KNIME or the
KNIME developer version): KNIME Base Package, (KNIME Development
Wizard), KNIME Extensions. You may now select the features you want to
install. If you select a feature and receive an error about a
configuration problem, click the "Select Required" button. This
automatically selects all required features. You need to restart KNIME
after installing new extensions in order to get them activated.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h2>Building a Data Flow</h2>

<p>You build a flow by dragging and dropping nodes from the Node
Repository into the Editor window and connecting them. Nodes are the
basic processing units of a workflow. Each node has input and/or output
ports. Data is transported through connections from these node output
ports into connected input ports. After positioning the nodes, you fully
connect the inputs of each node to outputs of a predecessor node. Click
on an output port and drag the connection to the input port that should
receive data from this output. Feedback loops are not permitted. Model
generating nodes also have model ports to transfer prediction or other
models (blue squares). Model ports should only be connected to ports
expecting the same kind of model.</p>

<h3>Nodes</h3>

<p><img src="img/quick/kMeansNode.png" alt="A sample node icon" />
Nodes in the editor appear with their icon, their name, their ports and
a traffic-light status display:</p>

<!-- 
<p>The background color indicates different node types. The available types are: Source
(any kind of data source, orange), Sink (any kind of persisting nodes, red),
Manipulator (Data transforming nodes, yellow), Miner (light-green), Predictor (dark-green),
View (nodes that display data, blue), Meta (nodes that can contain other
nodes, turquoise) and Other (brown).</p>
-->

<p>Ports on the left are input ports; the ones on the right are
output ports. Ports with a triangle are data ports. Data model ports are
represented by small blue squares. The status display has three states:
red, amber and green.</p>

<p>The red light means that the node is not ready to execute yet. It
is either not fully connected, some settings may be missing or
incorrect, or the state of the predecessor node is also red. User action
is required to set up this node.</p>

<p>When all settings have been made and all incoming ports are
connected, the node is ready to be executed and shows the amber light.</p>

<p>When a node is executed (i.e., the node has read the data from
its input ports, performed its task - such as filtering, transforming,
or clustering data, etc. - and has sent the result data and/or models to
its output ports), the status bar shows a green light.</p>

<h3><a name="ColorManager_Node">ColorManager Node</a></h3>

<p>A central KNIME node is the <em>Color Manager</em> node (in the
categories <em>Data Views</em> / <em>Property</em>) required to color
data rows. This color affects many views and helps to differentiate the
data. If you insert this node into the flow, the data rows will be coded
according to specific colors. In the settings of this node, colors are
mapped to values of an attribute. The color of a displayed data row
depends on the row's value for this attribute.</p>

<h3>Configuring Nodes</h3>

<p>After the flow is fully connected, nodes still showing a red
light need to be configured. If a node shows an amber state after
connecting it, the default settings have been applied. A right-click on
the node opens the context menu; the item <q>Configure</q> shows the
node's individual settings dialog. Adjust the settings as needed (refer
to the <em>Node Description</em> view for special node settings) and
close the dialog with <q>OK</q>. Re-configuring a previously executed
node resets it (i.e. all data or models computed during execution and
available at the output ports will be discarded). The user settings from
the dialog are stored with the flow when it is saved.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Executing a Data Flow</h3>

<p>When all nodes show an amber status the flow can be executed.
During execution a node performs its specific task (a filter node starts
filtering, a decision tree node builds its data model). Nodes are
executed from left to right, i.e. a node can only be executed once all
of its connected predecessors have finished executing. Execution is
triggered from the context menu (right-click) of a node. If you execute
a node at the end of the flow, the workbench will first execute all
predecessor nodes before the selected node is executed. You can select
multiple nodes in the flow and trigger execution for all of them;
optionally you can execute all executable nodes with the corresponding
button <img width="16" height="16" src="img/quick/executeAll.png"
	alt="Execute all button" /> in the action bar. The workbench
determines the order in which the nodes have to be executed and executes
nodes in parallel (each in its own thread), if possible. During
execution, the status indicator is replaced by a progress bar (see the
left Row Sampling node below) and a progress message can be seen by
hovering the mouse over the progress bar. A running node can be canceled
using the context menu. Successfully executed nodes switch to a green
status. Saving the workflow after execution stores all results. If
execution of a node was not able to be finished, (e. g. due to
cancelation or errors in the incoming data), an icon will appear in the
nodes symbol and a tooltip will display the warning or error message if
you move the mouse over that node's warning or error sign (see the right
Row Sampling node below).</p>
<img src="img/quick/RowSampling_running.png"
	alt="Running node with progress bar and tooltip showing progress message" />
<img src="img/quick/RowSampling_canceled.png"
	alt="Canceled node with tooltip showing warning message" />

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Displaying the Results</h3>

<p>Most nodes provide a view that displays their computed results.
To open a node's view, select the view from the context menu
(right-click) of the node. Some nodes may have multiple views, providing
different representations of their results. You can always open several
instances of a view to allow for different views of the same data. Most
views will only be displayed once the node has been executed. The color
of the data displayed in the views depends on the settings in the <em>Color
Manager</em> node. This should be inserted into the flow as a predecessor of
the view node(see Section <a href="#ColorManager_Node">Color Manager
Node</a>). If you do not include the <em>Color Manager</em>, all data is
displayed in gray.</p>

<h3>HiLiting</h3>

<p>If you select data in one view and hilite it, you can have it
hilited automatically in all other available views of the workflow that
support this function. Supporting views will either have a menu item in
the window menu bar or a context menu with a hilited entry. The hilited
data points are emphasized by orange color in all views showing the same
data, independent of whether the corresponding node is positioned
towards the beginning or towards the end of the flow. This even works
across different data models (if the transforming node supports it).</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h2>Uninstalling the Application</h2>

<p>If you want to delete KNIME from your system, first, close the
application, and then simply delete all files from your installation
directory: the directory to which you extracted the files.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h2>A Simple Example Flow</h2>

<p>We now want to take you step-by-step through the process of
building a small, simple work flow: we read in data from an ASCII file,
cluster the data and display the data in a table and a scatter plot.
After we execute this flow we will examine the data model that has been
built. We assume you have just started KNIME with an empty worksheet.</p>

<h4>Adding Nodes</h4>

<p>In the <em>Node Repository</em> expand the <em>IO</em> and the
contained <em>Read</em> category as depicted below (left side) and
Drag&amp;Drop the <em>File Reader</em> icon into the Editor window.</p>

<img src="img/quick/NodeRepositoryAll.png" alt="Node Repository" />

<p>The next node for now will be the <em>K-Means</em> clustering
algorithm. Expand the <em>Mining</em> category followed by the <em>Clustering</em>
category, and then drag the <em>K-Means</em> node to the flow.</p>
<p>In the search box of the <em>Node Repository</em>, enter <q>color</q>
and press Enter. This limits the nodes shown to the ones with <q>color</q>
in their name (see figure above in the middle). Pull the <em>Color
Manger Node</em> into the workflow (this node will define the color in the
data views later). To get all nodes back in the repository, press ESC in
the search field of the Repository View. Now, drag the <em>Interactive
Table</em> and the <em>Scatter Plot</em> from the <em>Data Views</em>
category to the Editor Window and position it to the right of the Color
Manager node.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h4>Connecting Nodes</h4>

<p>Now you need to connect the nodes in order to get the data
flowing. Click an output port and drag the connection to an appropriate
input port. Complete the flow as pictured below:</p>

<div id="screenshot"><img src="img/quick/kmeans_flow.png"
	alt="The above described workflow" /></div>

<p>Of course, your nodes will not show a green status, as long as
they are not configured and executed.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h4>Configuring Nodes</h4>

<p>Fully connected nodes still showing a red status icon need to be
configured.</p>

<p>Start with the File Reader, right-click it and select <em>Configure</em>
from the menu. Navigate to the &quot;IrisDataSet&quot; directory located
in the KNIME root directory. Select the <em>data.all</em> file from this
location. The dialog tries to guess the settings for the selected file.
For purposes this data set, these settings are just fine. The File
Reader's preview table shows a sample of the data. Press <em>OK</em> to
store the settings in the file reader node.</p>


<img src="img/quick/FileReaderDialog.png" alt="FileReader dialog" />

<p>You will see that once the node has been configured correctly, it
switches to yellow (meaning ready for execution). After that, the <em>K-Means</em>
node will immediately turn yellow, since its default settings will be
applied. To be sure, that the default settings fit your needs, open the
dialog and inspect the default settings.</p>
<p>In order to configure the Color Manager node you must first
execute the K-Means node. After execution all possible values and ranges
of all attributes are known: this meta information is propagated to the
successor nodes. The Color Manager needs this data before it can be
configured: Right-click on the K-Means node and choose Execute. Once it
has finished, open the configuration dialog of the Color Manger node.</p>
<p>Select the column that contains the attribute you want to use for
coloring and assign a color to each nominal value. The Color Manager, by
default, chooses the first nominal column (here the String column with
the class information) and assigns default colors to it. Choose the
column containing the cluster and click OK to close the dialog. You
might want to change the assigned color: select the attribute value and
choose a color in the color chooser panel below. The color will be
updated immediately. (Of course, also numeric data can be colored).</p>


<img src="img/quick/ColorManagerDialog.png" alt="Color Manager dialog" />

<p>The successor nodes do not need to be configured. The <em>Interactive
Table</em> node is a pure view node (it shows the data in a table) and has no
user settings, while the <em>K-Means</em> and the <em>Scatter Plot</em>
nodes apply default settings.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h4>Executing Nodes</h4>

<p>Now execute the <em>Scatter Plot</em> node by selecting <em>Execute</em>
from its context menu. The workbench will execute all predecessor nodes
for you. In a larger, more complex flow you could select multiple nodes
and trigger execution for all of them. The workflow manager will execute
the nodes as needed, each in its own thread, in parallel, if possible.<br />
Note, that the Interactive Table node is executed automatically. It does
not perform any time-consuming task during execute (it simply displays
data); therefore it executes itself whenever its successor has been
executed. This is a convenience feature.</p>

<p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to top</a></p>

<h4>Inspecting the Results</h4>

<p>In order to examine the data and the results, you need to open
the nodes' views. In our example, the K-Means, the Interactive Table and
the Scatter Plot have views. Open them from the nodes' context menus as
displayed in the figure of the flow. <br />
<em>The table view</em>: displays the data vectors in rows. Each row is
marked with the color set by the color manager node. There are several
renderers available for different data types, right click on the type
icon ( <img src="img/quick/double_type.png" alt="Double type symbol" />
in the column header in the table to try them out. The column with the
class labels is a String column ( <img src="img/quick/string_type.png"
	alt="String type symbol" />); instead of renderes this column just
provides a list with all possible values.<br />
<em>The K-Means view</em>: shows the resulting centroids.<br />
<em>The Scatter Plot view</em>: shows the data points with the colors
assinged to the clusters.<br />
</p>

<br />
<em>Hiliting</em>

<p>Select some points in the scatter plot and choose <em>Hilite
Selected</em> from the <em>Hilite</em> menu. The hilited points are marked
with an orange border. You will also see the hilited points in the table
view, where the row background of hilited rows is colored with orange as
displayed in the figure below. The propagation of the hilite status
works for all views in the flow displaying the same data.</p>

<div id="screenshot">
<img
	src="img/quick/kmeans_views_small.png"
	alt="The above described workflow with opened views" />
	</div>

<h2>Embark on your own voyage of discovery!</h2>

<p>Now this was just a very simple example to get you started. There
is a lot more to discover. Play with it! We tried to keep it simple and
intuitive. We would love to receive your feedback and find out what you
liked and what you did not like; things you find awkward or things that
did not seem to work. If you want to report a problem, it would be
helpful if you could provide us with a stack trace. This can be found in
the log file (&lt;workspace_dir&gt;/.metadata/knime/knime.log). <br />
To report a problem: send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@knime.org">contact@knime.org</a>
and be sure to include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a description on how to reproduce the problem,</li>
	<li>the log file from the workspace the problem occurred
	(&lt;workspace_dir&gt;/.metadata/knime/knime.log), and</li>
	<li>the workflow project (you can export any workflow project by
	right click on the project and select 'Export KNIME workflow...')</li>
	<li>note that the data you used is contained in the workflow if
	you save it. Be sure that you don't send confidential data.</li>
</ul>

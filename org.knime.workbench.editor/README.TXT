Plugin
----------------
de.unikn.knime.workbench.editor

Description
----------------
This plugin contains the complete GEF-based Workflow Editor.

Extension-Points
----------------


TODO
----------------
- Data access (=reading/writing .knime files) should be moved
  to the core-Plugin, as there might be other clients (e.g. non-graphical) 
  interested in loading knime flows in the future....
- The "model" part should/could also be refactored into the core plugin
